Currently, It can detect 15 diseases in 3 plants (Tomato, Potato, and Bell Pepper). The model is trained using a sequential model from TensorFlow by applying additional layers to it. *The accuracy is approximately **93%** on the testing dataset.* It also has the feature of getting current weather information.
